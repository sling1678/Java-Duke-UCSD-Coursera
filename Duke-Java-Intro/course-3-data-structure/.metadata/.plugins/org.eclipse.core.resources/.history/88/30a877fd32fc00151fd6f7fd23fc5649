/**
 * 
 * @author sling
 *
 * This assignments:
 * Write a new class WordLengths that has the following methods
 * 
 * Method void countWordLengths(String filename, int[] counts) that reads the file and 
 * computes the number of words of various lengths. Rules for counting lengths:
 * (1) ignore first or last character if that is not a letter - this will skip quotes
 * (2) there would be more complicated rules in a real program, but ignore those complications.
 * (3) for any words that are larger than the length of array counts[], then count that word 
 * in the counts[count.length-1] element.
 * 
 * Method void testCountWordLengths() should create a FileReader o you can select a file, and 
 * creates a counts integer array of size 31. This method should call countWordLengths 
 * with a file and then print the number of words of each length. Test it on the small 
 * file smallHamlet.txt shown below.
 * 
 * Method indexOfMax(int[] values) that returns the index element of the largest element 
 * in the values. Use this in the testCountWordLengths() to determine the most common word 
 * length in the file. Test this on file smallHamlet.txt.
