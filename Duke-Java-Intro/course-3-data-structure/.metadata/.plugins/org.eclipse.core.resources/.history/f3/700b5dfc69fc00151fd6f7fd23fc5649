/**
 * Assignment:
 * Create the TestCaesarCipher class with the following parts:
 * Include the methods countLetters and maxIndex that you wrote in the previous lesson.
 * Write the void method simpleTests that has no parameters. 
 * This method should read in a file as a String, create a CaesarCipher object with key 18, 
 * encrypt the String read in using the CaesarCipher object, print the encrypted String, 
 * and decrypt the encrypted String using the decrypt method. 
 * Write the method breakCaesarCipher that has one String parameter named input. 
 * This method should figure out which key was used to encrypt this message 
 * (in a similar manner as the previous lesson), then create a CaesarCipher object 
 * with that key and decrypt the message.In the simpleTests method, add a call 
 * to breakCaesarCipher on the encrypted String to decrypt it automatically by 
 * determining the key, and print the decrypted String.
