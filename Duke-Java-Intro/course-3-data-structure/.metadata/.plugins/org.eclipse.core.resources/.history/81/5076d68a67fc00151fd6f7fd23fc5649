/**
 * Create the CaesarCipher class with the following parts:
 * Private fields for the alphabet and shiftedAlphabet.
 * Write a constructor CaesarCipher that has one int parameter key. 
 * This method should initialize all the private fields of the class.
 * Write an encrypt method that has one String parameter named input. 
 * This method returns a String that is the input encrypted using shiftedAlphabet.
 * Write a decrypt method that has one String parameter named input. 
 * This method returns a String that is the encrypted String decrypted using the key 
 * associated with this CaesarCipher object. One way to do this is to create another 
 * private field mainKey, which is initialized to be the value of key. 
 * Then you can create a CaesarCipher object within decrypt: 
 * CaesarCipher cc = new CaesarCipher(26 - mainKey); and call cc.encrypt(input).
