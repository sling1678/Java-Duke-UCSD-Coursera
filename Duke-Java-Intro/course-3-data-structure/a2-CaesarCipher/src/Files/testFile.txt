Write the void method testCaesar that has no parameters. 
This method should read a file and encrypt the complete file 
using the Caesar Cipher algorithm, printing the encrypted message. 
You may want to include the lines:
FileResource fr = new FileResource();
String message = fr.asString();
String encrypted = encrypt(message, key);
System.out.println("key is " + key + "\n" + encrypted);
